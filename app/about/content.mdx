I'm a passionate technologist and entrepreneur with a strong focus on building innovative solutions that make an impact. As a Co-founder at [Techentrance](https://techentrance.com), I'm dedicated to creating platforms that empower developers and tech enthusiasts.

With expertise in modern web technologies and a keen eye for user experience, I specialize in developing scalable and efficient applications. My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning.

I'm currently leading the development efforts at Techentrance, where we're building tools and resources to help developers excel in their careers. My experience spans across the full stack, with a particular interest in creating seamless user experiences.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or mentoring aspiring developers. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and am excited to be part of that change.
