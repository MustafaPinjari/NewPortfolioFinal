### Why I Redesigned My Website This Easter

Easter is usually a time of renewal, reflection, and chocolate-induced clarity. This year, it also became the perfect excuse to finally tackle something I’d been putting off for too long: _redesigning my website_.

### Reasons why I wanted to redesign my website

1. It No Longer Felt Like _Me_ <br />
   Over time, websites can start to feel like old outfits—what once fit perfectly starts to feel outdated. My site didn’t reflect where I am today in terms of skills, goals, or personality. I wanted something that felt more aligned with my current vibe: **cleaner**, **faster**, and more **intentional**.

2. I Wanted to Play With New Ideas <br />
   Redesigning a personal site is the perfect excuse to experiment. Easter gave me a reason to tinker with layouts, try out that new animation idea, and explore visual storytelling in a way I hadn’t before. Not everything made the final cut—but the process was half the fun.

3. I Wanted to Enjoy the Site Again <br />
   Let’s be real—if you're not excited to share your own website, it’s probably time to do something about it. I wanted to be proud of every page, every interaction, every micro-detail. Easter gave me the nudge (and the quiet long weekend) to do just that.

### I Couldn’t Let Go of the Old Homepage—So I Hid It

As much as I was excited about the redesign, part of me was still nostalgic for the old homepage. It had been through a lot with me. So instead of scrapping it entirely, I moved it to a [secret](/old-home) route — a little time capsule for anyone curious to see where things started. It’s my way of honoring the past while stepping into what’s next.
